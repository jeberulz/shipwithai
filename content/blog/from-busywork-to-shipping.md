Most teams do not have a tooling problem. They have a rhythm problem.

A practical weekly rhythm:

- Monday: strategy, scope, and constraints.
- Tuesday: exploration and fast concept generation.
- Wednesday: prototype plus usability checks.
- Thursday: implementation handoff with test criteria.
- Friday: shipping review and retrospective.

Each day gets one AI lane:

- Synthesis
- Exploration
- Refinement
- Handoff
- Reflection

This model keeps AI use intentional and measurable instead of random and reactive.
